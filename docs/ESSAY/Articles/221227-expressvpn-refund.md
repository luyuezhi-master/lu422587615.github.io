# ExpressVPN 退款经历

> 221227

ExpressVPN 从两会开始就完全用不了了，虽然退出了 Pick for Me 节点，但是最后的结果经常是 Unable to connect。想着过了两会就行了，结果后面国内的大规模抗议事件导致 ExpressVPN 又被封掉。再然后这事情过去了还是连不上，显然这就是被针对了啊。还是选择私人搭建的机场吧，感觉各方面来说，都会好一些。

Thank you for contacting ExpressVPN Support. My name is Xxxx. How may I help you today?

I have to say that I cannot use ExpressVPN in China for about 2 months. Could you please return the money back to me?
I ensure that I use the latest version and choose Pick for Me. However, it just not works.

I understand that you are getting some issues with the connection in China and wish to get a refund. Let me see what I can do about the situation.
To ensure that I have the correct account to assist you with your request, can you verify that this is the email you provided xxx@xxx.com?

yes

Got it! Please bear with me for a moment while I quickly review your account.
Thanks for waiting! I'm sorry to hear that you are still getting connection issues while in China. We have been helping people in your situation for many years, and we're proud of our record of quality service. But the challenge presented by these most recent roadblocks has been unprecedented.
On the other hand, if you would still give us a chance, I do assure you that Our engineers will continue their efforts to restore normal connectivity. In fact, we are monitoring everything 24/7 and looking forward to getting this resolved at the soonest time possible.

I do know that ExpressVPN does your best to build connections in China. However, I have been waiting for around 2 months, and the situation still exists.

I really do appreciate your patience on this matter. Your loyalty means everything to us. In the meantime, please bookmark our China status page for links to our latest app versions, recommended server locations, and other information for the highest chance of connecting to the VPN: https://www.rtvvdqc.com/support/troubleshooting/china-status/

If it is possible, please let me get the refund. The service doesn't work in China, which we (both providers and users) all know clearly.

I completely respect your decision. Please wait a moment while I prepare your cancellation and refund request.
Thanks for waiting! I will be escalating your refund request to our Billing Team. They will be getting in touch with you via email to let you know once the refund is completed.
Before we wrap up our ExpressVPN partnership, please know we're pleased and humbled to have you as part of our company for a period of time.

Okay I got it. Looking forward to the refund email. Thank you for your help.

Hello,
Thank you for reaching out to us. We don't usually provide pro-rata refunds outside of our 30-day money-back guarantee, as we offer discounts for 6 and 12-month VPN subscriptions because it represents a commitment to that length of service.
However, under the circumstances, we can process a partial refund of $74.05.  Please confirm if we should proceed.
We appreciate your support and kind understanding.
Regards,
Xxxxxxx

我今年9.10买了一年，$100。退了75%也刚好就是剩下的九个月（虽然这三个月基本上没法用）……

## 尾声

总之顺利退款了就好，不是一笔小钱。关于国内的网络环境管理啊，我只能说笑死。有人提在国内做开源——连所谓的「互联网」都没有，你做什么开源啊。
